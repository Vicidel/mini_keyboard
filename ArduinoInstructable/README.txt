The creator of this folder is Foster Phillips. My Instagram is Lego_Rocket_08 and was originally posted on Instructables.com My username is FosterP on Instructables. Please consider checking me out. Also, feel free to contact me through these if you have any issues.
The ArrowKeypad and ColorTest code was made by me. I own this code.

The ScreenScan code was NOT made by me. It is made by Arduino, and I only have it in this folder for your convienience.
the ssd1306_128x32_i2c code was also NOT made by me. It is made by Adafruit, for their gfx and ssd1306 libraries.
I do not own the two pieces of code listed above, I am only providing them for convienence. (You will still need to download and install the libraries to run them.)
